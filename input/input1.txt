Talk to your stakeholders before building any data product. Understand the business’ needs at the current stage: If it’s a startup, I bet your stakeholder won’t care too much about the format and color of the data visualizations you build but wants to instead focus on the accuracy of the data behind the visualizations and insights from them. Similarly, truly understand the audience and use case; for example, you would spend more time on a polished and simple user interface if the data product is intended to be used regularly by non-technical audiences.
